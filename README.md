# PA-2

For the first problem, we first initialized the 5x5 array with the function randn() in numpy's random class. For its parameters, we set it to 5, 5 to indicate that we want a 5x5 array. Then, we got the mean and standard deviation of the array with the functions mean() and std(), respectively. Using the formula for normalization, we got the normalized version of the array by deducting the mean of the array to itself and dividing the whole thing with its standard deviation.
